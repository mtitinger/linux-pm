CPU Clusters and PM domain

Newer ARM CPUs are grouped in a SoC as clusters. A cluster in addition to the
CPUs may have caches, GIC, VFP and architecture specific power controller to
power the cluster. A cluster may also be nested in another cluster, the
hierarchy of which is depicted in the device tree. CPUIdle frameworks enables
the CPUs to determine the sleep time and enter low power state to save power
during periods of idle. CPUs in a cluster may enter and exit idle state
independently. During the time when all the CPUs are in idle state, the
cluster can safely be in idle state as well. When the last of the CPUs is
powered off as a result of idle, the cluster may also be powered down, but the
domain must be powered on before the first of the CPUs in the cluster resumes
execution.

ARM SoCs can power down the CPU and resume execution in a few uSecs and the
domain that powers the CPU cluster also have comparable idle latencies. The
ARM CPU WFI signal is used as a hardware trigger for the cluster hardware to
enter their idle state. The hardware can be programmed in advance to put the
cluster in the desired idle state befitting the wakeup latency requested by
the CPUs. When all the CPUs in a cluster have executed their WFI instruction,
the state machine for the power controller may put the cluster components in
their power down or idle state. Generally, the domains would power on with the
hardware sensing the CPU's interrupts. The domains may however, need to be
reconfigured by the CPU to remain active, until the last CPU is ready to enter
idle again. To power down a cluster, it is generally required to power down
all the CPUs. The caches would also need to be flushed. The hardware state of
some of the components may need to be saved and restored when powered back on.
SoC vendors may also have hardware specific configuration that must be done
before the cluster can be powered off. When the cluster is powered off,
notifications may be sent out to other SoC components to scale down or even
power off their resources.

Power management domains represent relationship of devices and their power
controllers. They are represented in the DT as domain consumers and providers.
A device may have a domain provider and a domain provider may support multiple
domain consumers. Domains like clusters, may also be nested inside one
another. A domain that has no active consumer, may be powered off and any
resuming consumer would trigger the domain back to active. Parent domains may
be powered off when the child domains are powered off. ARM CPU cluster can be
fashioned as a PM domain. When the CPU devices are powered off, the PM domain
may be powered off.

The code in Generic PM domains handles the hierarchy of devices, domains and
the reference counting of objects leading to last man down and first man up.
The ARM CPU domains common code defines PM domains for each CPU cluster and
attaches the domains' CPU devices to as specified in the DT. This happens
automatically at kernel init, when the domain is specified as compatible with
"arm,pd". Powering on/off the common cluster hardware would also be done when
the PM domain is runtime suspended or resumed.
